This project is a simple autonomous race car developed for the **Formula Student Driverless Simulator**. The car uses **LIDAR** as its primary sensor for perception and navigation. It is built on **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** for communication, control, and decision-making.

The goal of the project is to enable the car to navigate a race track autonomously by processing LIDAR data to detect obstacles, plan paths, and make driving decisions in real-time. The system focuses on simplicity and efficiency, leveraging ROS2's modular architecture for seamless integration of perception, planning, and control components.

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with autonomous systems, LIDAR-based perception, ROS2, and simulation environments, preparing you for advanced robotics and autonomous vehicle development.

Due to an existing bug in the simulation, the car experiences a sudden and unintended acceleration when the throttle input exceeds a certain threshold. This behavior can cause instability in speed control during autonomous operation.
